# Reproducibility and containers

These exercises are adapted from the [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org/) lessons
[Reproducible research and FAIR data](https://coderefinery.github.io/reproducible-research/).

If you want to try to build a container but you need to install Singularity/Apptainer on your laptop:
- Reproducibility-3

If you have access to a cluster:
- Reproducibility-3
- Reproducibility-4

If you want exercises where you don't need to type or install anything but "only" think and discuss:
- Reproducibility-1
- Reproducibility-2

If you have your own code project and want to try to containerize it:
- Reproducibility-5
