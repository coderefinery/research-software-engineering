# Version control and documentation

These exercises are adapted from the [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org/) lessons:
- [Introduction to version control with Git](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/)
- [Collaborative distributed version control](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/)
- [How to document your research software](https://coderefinery.github.io/documentation/)


## Exercise Git-and-documentation-1: Put your (example) project under version control

---

## Exercise Git-and-documentation-2: Backup/publish your (example) project to GitHub/GitLab/YourServer

---

## Exercise Git-and-documentation-3: Practice code review with somebody else

Instructions are work in progress but the big picture is:
- Students work in pairs of two
- They create an example repository on GitHub or share one of their recent repositories
- The other student sends a pull request with a small improvement

## Exercise Git-and-documentation-4: Improve the README of your project

In this exercise we will try to add a README to your project. If you have one
already, we will try to improve it by following the checklist from the
[presentation
slides](https://cicero.xyz/v3/remark/0.14.0/github.com/coderefinery/research-software-engineering/main/presentation.md/):

- **Purpose**
- **Installation instructions**
- **Dependencies and their versions or version ranges**
- **Copy-paste-able example to get started**
- Tutorials covering key functionality
- Reference documentation (e.g. API) covering all functionality
- How do you want to be asked questions (mailing list or forum or chat or issue tracker)
- Possibly a FAQ section
- Authors
- **Recommended citation**
- License
- Contribution guide
