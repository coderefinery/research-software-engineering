# Research software engineering ("CodeRefinery in 1 hour")

"CodeRefinery in 1 hour" - What are good tools and practices in research software engineering?

- [Presentation slides](https://cicero.xyz/v3/remark/0.14.0/github.com/coderefinery/research-software-engineering/main/presentation.md/)
- [Exercise repository](https://coderefinery.github.io/research-software-engineering/)

## Overview

- What is "research software"?
- CodeRefinery
- 6 most important topics (in the HPC context)
- Exercises (separate repo)


## Version control

- Motivation for version control
- Commits: keeping track of changes
- Features: roll-back, branching, merging, collaboration
- Reproducibility
- Collaboration through branches or forks
- Code review
- Where to start?


## Documentation

- Why?
- Checklist
- In-code documentation
- Often a README is enough
- When projects grow out of a README


## Reproducibility and containers

- FAIR principles
- HS slide
- Directory structure
- Tracking dependencies
- Tracking computational steps
- Recording environments ("it works on my machine")
- Containers
- ReproHacks and time travel


## Building code with CMake

- Overview of tools
- Motivation for CMake
- CMake demo
- Detecting the environment
- Finding and using dependencies


## Automated testing

- How automated testing looks in practice
- Motivation
- Unit tests and end-to-end tests
- Where to start and how far to go


## Sharing and reusing

- Why software licenses matter
- When should I add a license?
- Is your work derivative work or not?
- How do I add a license to my work?
- Make it persistent and citable
- Great resources
